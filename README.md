> A charming general game player.


Getting started
---------------

You need to checkout the project using git.

After doing so, you can either chose to work with eclipse or IDEA. With eclipse you can use palamedes which gives you
general game playing perspective over your project, allows you to debug GDL, etc. etc. In both cases, you will get all
dependencies with sources attached to you project.

## Use eclipse

You can use maven to generate an eclipse project for you by running

> mvn eclipse:eclipse

## Use IDEA

You can create a new project from a maven project in IDEA by doing

> File -> New Project -> Import project from external model -> Maven

and point to the directory which you checked out earlier.
